    class. However, most use-cases should be covered by the existing space
    classes (e.g. `Box`, `Discrete`, etc...), and container classes (`Tuple` &
    `Dict`). Note that parametrized probability distributions (through the
    `sample()` method), and batching functions (in `gym.vector.VectorEnv`), are
    only well-defined for instances of spaces provided in gym by default.
    Moreover, some implementations of Reinforcement Learning algorithms might
    not handle custom spaces properly. Use custom spaces with care.
